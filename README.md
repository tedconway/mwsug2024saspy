# Bring Your SAS and Python Worlds Together With SASPy!
MWSUG 2024 Presentation

What if you could combine the powers of SAS and Python? That's the idea behind SASPy, the open-source Python package that enables Python coders to access SAS data and analytics capabilities. In this session, we'll see how SASPy can be used to integrate SAS and Python – even across platforms – bringing you the best of both worlds! SASPy can be used in a variety of SAS, Viya and Python deployments. For this session, a laptop-based Microsoft Visual Studio notebook running Python will be used together with Base SAS 9.4 via the Cloud-based SAS® OnDemand for Academics to create an interactive Sunburst chart visualization of an NBA salary SAS dataset.
